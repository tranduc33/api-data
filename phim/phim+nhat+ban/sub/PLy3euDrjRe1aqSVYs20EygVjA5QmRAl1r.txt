                "description": "President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he will pressure governors to reopen schools and colleges this fall, arguing that some want to keep schools closed for political reasons against the will of families.\n\nTrump said he is \"very much gong to put pressure on governors and everybody else to open the schools.\"\n\nTrump did not immediately explain how he would pressure governors, but he repeated an earlier claim that Democrats want to keep schools closed for political reasons and not health reasons\n\n\"It's very important for our country. It's very important for the well-being of the student and the parents. So we're going to be putting a lot of pressure on,\" Trump said during a round table discussion.\n\nFirst Lady Melania Trump also encouraged schools to reopen. \"When children are out of school, they are missing more than just time in the classroom. They are missing the laughter of their friends, learning from their teachers and the joy of recess and play,\" she said.\n\nTrump and the First Lady were both not wearing masks, along with Vice President Mike Pence, at the round table meeting.\n\nThe White House event was part of an all-out effort to get the nation's schools to reopen even amid the coronavirus pandemic.\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel: https://bit.ly/2TwO8Gm\n\nQUICKTAKE ON SOCIAL:\nFollow QuickTake on Twitter: twitter.com/quicktake\nLike QuickTake on Facebook: facebook.com/quicktake\nFollow QuickTake on Instagram: instagram.com/quicktake\nSubscribe to our newsletter: https://bit.ly/2FJ0oQZ\nEmail us at quicktakenews@gmail.com\n\nQuickTake by Bloomberg is a global news network delivering up-to-the-minute analysis on the biggest news, trends and ideas for a new generation of leaders.",

                "description": "Zeitgeist: Addendum was born out of public interest in possible solutions to the cultural issues presented in Zeitgeist: The Movie. Building upon the topics of social distortion and corruption, Addendum moves to also present possible solutions. Featured in the work is former “Economic Hit-man” and New York Times bestselling author, John Perkins, along with The Venus Project, an organisation for social redesign created by Social Engineer and Industrial Designer Jacque Fresco. Part One explains the process of Money Creation and Expansion through the Fractional Reserve System. It explains how Debt and Bankruptcy are not mere byproducts of our current system, but rather are underlying realities of our existence with periodic failures guaranteed. Part Two exposes various levels of international corruption via the financial/corporate system, including the manipulation of public leaders to further the interests of corporate institutions. Part Three changes gears and depicts a possible solution to the growing social problems in the world today by the introduction of a new social concept known as a “Resource-Based Economy”. Finally, Part Four gives a philosophical perspective in the hope to inspire change in the viewer and enable action to affect society for the better.\n\nDistributed by Sideways Films\n\nSubscribe here for more full length documentaries: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFrO-dKhooOuTtix5dia2_g?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWelcome to Reel Truth the home of amazing documentaries!

                "description": "The quality of our intimate relationships has a profound impact on our psychological health as well as our physical health.  Meghna sheds light on the critical importance of properly educating people on romance and sexuality across the lifespan.  Thought-provoking information paired with stunning photos and a touch of humor make this talk compelling and heart-warming.  Meghna's talk is a breath of fresh air, offering a modern approach to teaching and learning about the birds-and-the-bees so that we can finally begin investing in what really matters in life. Award-winning instructor and Ph.D. candidate Meghna Mahambrey studies, teaches, and conducts research on all things romance and sex. She has been instructing college courses for nearly a decade, presents original research at national and international conferences, and is a featured speaker at special events. With a Master's Degree in Education as well as a Master's Degree in Human Development and Family Science, Meghna is currently completing a doctoral degree at The Ohio State University with a focus on sexual satisfaction in marriage.  In addition to teaching at the university-level, Meghna also offers workshops to the general community.  Her mission is to bridge the gap between research and real life and educate adults on matters close to their hearts (and hips). This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx",

With the Trump Administration, we may very well be headed back to those dark ages.\n \nIn this timely webinar, experts from Advocates for Youth will lay out the facts: that only comprehensive sex education programs have been proven to reduce teen pregnancy, delay sexual activity, and increase contraceptive use.\n \nIn addition to the facts explaining why progressive programs work and conservative policies don’t, our speakers will describe the political, policy and organizing steps taken in a particular legislative campaign, what made it successful, and how you can apply those lessons to your state, locality or school district.\n\nAbbey Marr, State Policy Analyst at Advocates for Youth, will provide an overview of current state & local level sex education policy, and options for proactive policy in your own jurisdictions. Scarlett Jimenez, of Advocates for Youth’s Colorado Cultural Advocacy and Mobilization Initiative (CAMI) Council, will describe Colorado’s 2013 campaign to pass comprehensive sex education bill, what made it successful, and the lessons they learned.",

It brings to life the many messages that are so crucial in understanding this disease on a community level.\n \nThe film makes visible the invisible Ebola germs to help people see and understand how Ebola spreads and how to protect themselves. Critical messages are woven through the story so that people better understand Ebola, see themselves within the context of an outbreak, and see how to act in ways that can keep themselves safe from the disease and protect their communities.\n\nThis film is intended to help meet the need for better education and awareness that is critical in eradicating this disease in West Africa, and whenever and wherever potential outbreaks may threaten communities in the future. \n\nDirector:  Yoni Goodman\n\nProducer:  Deborah Van Dyke\n\nStory:   Deborah Van Dyke\n\nExecutive producer:  Peter Cardellichio\n\nAssociate producers:  Mark Binder, Simon Lawson\n\nArt director:  Uri Inks\n\nAnimators:  Yoni Goodman, Sefi Gayego, Elie Klimis\n\nVfx and post production:  Yoni Goodman\n\nEnglish narration:  Ayesha Casely-Hayford\nRecorded at:  Just Voices, London, UK\nRecording technician:  Peter Warnock\nMusic, sound FX, and mix:  Uri Kalian – Sweetsound\n\nContent reviewers:  Ombretta Baggio, IFRC; Jonathan Shadid, UNICEF; Alif Iman Nurlambang, IFRC; Amanda McClelland, IFRC\n\nSpecial thanks to the staff and volunteers of the National Red Cross Societies of Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea who have inspired, guided, and supported the development of this film with their tireless work and passionate commitment to the people in need.\n\nThis film was produced with support from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, UNICEF, mPowering Frontline Health Workers, and individual donations from Deborah Rose and friends from the Mad River Valley, Vermont – and beyond.\n\nCopyright © 2015,  Global Health Media Project.

Relationships and sexuality education in Wales has been transformed thanks to Professor Emma Renold. Her pioneering participatory research enables children and young people to speak out about gender and sexual violence. Findings from Professor Renold’s research on the role of education in preventing gender and sexual violence were extensively cited by the Welsh Government in the Violence Against Women, Domestic Abuse and Sexual Violence (VAWDASV) Act, passed in 2015.",
