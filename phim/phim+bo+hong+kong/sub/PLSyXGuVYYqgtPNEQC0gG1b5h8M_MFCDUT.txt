                "description": "What Should You Do If You're Bitten by a Venomous Snake?\n     There is a story taking place in Northern India, with episodes similar to the classic love story Romeo and Juliet. But the story changed last minute, the Indian version of Juliet is still alive. According to Gulf News, Shankar Rai, who lived in Northern India, was bitten by a venomous snake when sleeping at home. The next morning, feeling he would not pass, Shankar spoke to his wife, said his last wish was that the couple die at the same time, the same day together. When the wife agreed, Shankar bit his wife's wrist. Not long after, both spouses lost consciousness. Both were discovered shortly afterwards and quickly taken to the hospital. Unfortunately, when they were taken to the hospital, Shankar had died, and his wife was still alive and saved. When partially recovering, the wife said, before biting his wife's wrist, Mr. Shankar confided a lot, saying that because he loved his wife so much, did not want the yin and yang separated, he wanted the couple to die together. Moved by her husband's affection, she allowed her husband to bite her. Currently, she feels very sad because she is still alive but her husband is no more.\nsubscriber:https://bitly.com.vn/cBaat\nPage: https://bom.to/aUpDEN\n#Art_Life Experience #Life Experience",

                "description": "Disney And Pixar Movies Get Banned In Many Countries\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant\n\nWhen thinking about Disney and Pixar movies, you might imagine that there is nothing that they could possibly do that would warrant censorship. These are kids movies, after all? How could something about a cartoon bear or someone’s feelings become controversial at all? \nWell, it may surprise you to learn that a ton of Disney movies have faced censorship and even banning over the years, for a whole slew of reasons! \nSometimes people take offence to what is being shown on screen, or they don’t think the content is appropriate for young audiences. Recently, the Pixar movie Onward has been in the news for the fact that its openly LGBTQ character was censored in Russia, and the line about her girlfriend was taken out of the movie entirely. While it might seem like those things don’t happen in North America, a movie theatre in Alabama that refused to show the live action Beauty and The Beast because of one shot in which LeFou danced with another man might just make you feel differently. \nThere are movies like Abominable, which was banned in parts of Southeast Asia because of ties to a long standing political conflict, moments like a kiss that was removed from the Mulan remake, and crazy covers of old VHS tapes of The Little Mermaid that contained a little… secret. Disney and Pixar movies have been censored and banned all over the world, check out the video below for all of the mind-boggling reasons why!  \n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/",

                "description": "Did you catch these small details in MCU movies?\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant\n\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe is full of the most amazing production design and effects in modern cinema. And Marvel Studios loves to honor the fans by finding ways to include tiny details and Easter Eggs only the most eagle-eyed will notice. In fact, there are some that go by so quickly, you’d probably need to watch the scene in slow motion just to pick up on them. \n\nFor instance, did you know that Howard the Duck appeared not only in the first ‘Guardians of the Galaxy’ film, he also made an appearance during ‘Avengers: Endgame’s’ big finale. Scott Lang might have been the first to confirm that the Avengers’ plan to travel through time and bring back the Infinity Stones paid off, but he was also the first to receive the brunt of Thanos’s massive missile strike. \n\n‘Spider-Man: Homecoming’ found a way to honor Captain America’s Howling Commandos with a really cool reference. Additionally, the film honored the very first issue Spider-Man ever appeared in in a really subtle and clever way. There’s also a tease for Wakanda as early as 2010’s ‘Iron Man 2,’ when the country appears on one of the holographic maps behind Tony Stark. There are also some fun references to the TV show ‘Arrested Development,’ which the Russo Brothers worked on before they got the call from Marvel.\n\nAnd these are only the beginning! Tune in to the full video to see all the fantastic, subtle Easter Eggs Marvel Studios managed to fit into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nFeaturing: \n\nEntry 1 - HOWARD THE DUCK CAMEO\nEntry 2 - ANT-MAN SHRINKING\nEntry 3 - JIM MORITA, HOWLING COMMANDO\nEntry 4 - CAP’S TO-DO LIST\nEntry 5 - BLACK WIDOW’S ARROW NECKLACE\nEntry 6 - SOLVING TIME TRAVEL\nEntry 7 - MAP OF WAKANDA\nEntry 8 - AUNT MAY’S LICENSE PLATE\nEntry 9 - ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT\nEntry 10 - TEN RINGS TATTOO\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/",

But with this cinematic infatuation, often comes a deluge of destruction.\n\nBeing such a recognizable city, it's not surprising that it would be the site of some pretty catastrophic events. Be it asteroids raining down on the famous New York skyline, or mutant vampire monsters running amok through Times Square, there have been some pretty interesting ways that the City that Never Sleeps has been forced to take a permanent nap.\n\nAnd in this video, we are going to be taking a look at that very concept, and breaking down some of the most exciting ways that the big city has bit the big one, either in its entirety or just partially. Basically, if something gets blown up or otherwise taken out in spectacular fashion in the Big Apple, we’re gonna talk about it.

                "description": "10 Animated Movie Characters That Died On Screen! Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6\n\nAnimated films are great for children to learn life lessons. Unfortunately, sometimes these life lessons involve death. While it's common for animated films to allude to death and have a character die off screen, some of them pushed the limits by showcasing a character die on screen.\n\nIn the film Tangled, Rapunzel's adoptive mother and kidnapper stays eternally young until the magical powers go away and she withers away in front of our eyes. Monster House features a pretty horrific backstory including carnival side-show act that falls to her death and gets buried alive in cement. The straight-to-DVD film Green Lantern: Emerald Knights features a pretty disturbing death involving a decapitation. Tarzan's great jungle adventure reaches a dramatic finale when Clayton gets tangled up in the wrong vine and is literally hung to death. The Land Before Time features a dramatic scene where Little Foot learns some tough lessons on life and death as his mother passes away. The death of an insect may seem like nothing until you see it happen to poor Ray in The Princess and the Frog and Charlotte in Charlotte's Web. Inside Out showcased a terrible death to a character that has deeper meaning than anyone can imagine. The Black Cauldron took animated deaths to a whole new level as the Horned King was burned alive. The Lion King features the tragic death of Mufasa at the hands of Scar and it still haunts us to this day. Watch to see how all of these deaths played out on screen!\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\nhttps://plus.google.com/+ScreenRant\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/",

The latest attempt at this is Artemis Fowl, based on the hugely successful book series of the same name.\n\nThe movie adaptation definitely raises a lot of questions. Like did the writers actually read the books or just glance through a wikipedia page? Why is there so much exposition in this thing? Why does the whole thing take place in a house? Why isn’t Artemis an evil genius like he was in the books? What exactly is going on with all this magic stuff? Did we really need to see Josh Gad in Hagrid cosplay shoot a bunch of dirt out of his butt? Who is this movie for?\n\nTo answer all these questions and more, step inside the pitch meeting that led to Artemis Fowl! It’ll be super easy, barely an inconvenience.\n\n\nCheck Out These Other Amazing Videos:\n\nCATS Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsNAu72v2Yc\n\nDisney Plus Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFeZx3Xkvgg\n\nCheck out the Behind The Screen Podcast - By Screen Rant on Spotify!\nhttps://open.spotify.com/show/6sMJkP1E4N7kPYL5v9OW3v\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/",

Es más que su buena apariencia y su comportamiento realista. Tiene un talento, una habilidad que no tienen comparación con muchos de sus compañeros. Además, su poder de permanencia le ha permitido permanecer en la lista A durante un par de décadas. En última instancia, hace que parezca fácil y eso, en sí mismo, es una hazaña asombrosa. \n\nTras un memorable giro en Thelma y Louise, los 90 se convirtieron en la gran década de Brad Pitt. Hizo papeles icónicos como en “El Club de la Pelea\", Entrevista con el Vampiro, Se7en, y Doce Monoso - sólo por nombrar algunos. A principios del 2000, se consolidó como un icono de Hollywood alcanzando un estatus de superestrella que rivalizaba con los actores de la época dorada de Hollywood, al participar en un remake de la película de la época del Rat Pack, La Cuadrilla de los Once. Participé después en varias secuelas del atraco. Tras obtener un éxito continuo y varios premios con películas poco convencionales como Benjamin Button y El árbol de la Vida, Pitt ha encontrado un lugar junto a Quentin Tarantino, en películas como Bastardos sin gloria, Django sin cadenas y ahora Erase una vez en Hollywood. \n\nÚnete a De película mientras exploramos exactamente lo que hace a Brad Pitt uno de los mejores en el negocio. Comprobaremos sus hábitos alimenticios, sus técnicas de ejercicio y su estilo de actuación para ver cómo este tipo de Oklahoma se convirtió en una estrella de cine digna de la alfombra roja.",

Especificamente, estamos analisando os personagens da Sonserina dos sete livros de JK Rowling.\n\nEstamos longe da Criança Amaldiçoada e dos Animais Fantásticos, porque, bem, é o melhor. Não queremos que eles estraguem nossa festa.\n\nVocê provavelmente supõem que cobriremos seus sonserinos básicos como Crabbe e Goyle, e você está certo. Claro, há muito mais na casa do lendário Salazar Sonserina do que apenas a família e os amigos Malfoy. \nDois famosos professores de Hogwarts, Horace Slughorn e Severus Snape, eram estudantes da Sonserina. Então, é claro, existem as pessoas más que ajudaram a criar os conceitos errados da Sonserina. É isso mesmo, estamos falando de você, Voldemort, e você também, Bellatrix Lestrange! A família Black parece constantemente andar no limite entre Grifinória e Sonserina em todos os momentos!\n\nPorém, esta lista é mais do que apenas quem está nela, prometemos! É sobre quais diferenças existem na personalidade e na aparência física.\n\nOk, os filmes de Harry Potter são ótimos, mas deixam de fora detalhes cruciais. Detalhes que adicionam camadas de complexidade a esses assistentes sombrios. Os Malfoys e os Snape são bem melhores nos livros. Isso é apenas um fato, pessoal. Não acredita na gente? Então você precisa assistir esse vídeo agora.\n\n\nSe liga também nestes vídeos incríveis:\n\nDragon Ball: 10 Vezes Que Vegeta Ajudou Goku\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yas3jOj4uyI\n\nHarry Potter: 10 Momentos Estranhos No Set\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYvqITJj5AY\n\n\nNossas redes sociais:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant \nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant \n\nNosso site:\nhttps://screenrant.com/",

                "description": "10 Popular Cartoon Rip Offs That Actually Exist! Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant\n\nThe worlds most popular cartoons are ripped-off on a fairly regular basis. In some cases, the resulting rip-offs are nothing more than cheap, inferior imitations of the originals, but occasionally they can end up being just as popular (if not even more so) than the ones theyre imitating. In this video, were going to take you through some examples of both (therell be examples of how copying should be done and how it really shouldnt be done). The examples well be including are as follows; the fact that Seth MacFarlanes Family Guy clearly copies (or at least parodies) Matt Groenings long-running The Simpsons, the fact that the awful Coconut Freds Fruit Salad Island! blatanly copies SpongeBob SquarePants, the fact that Yo-Kai Watch totally steals the entire concept of Pokemon (with supernatural beings instead of animal-esque creatures), the fact that Samurai Pizza Cats, Kung Fu Dino Posse and Street Sharks all took the idea of anthropomorphic animals fighting evil from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the fact that Johnny Test was essentially just Dexters Laboratory with some gender-swapping, the fact that the 1978 Run, Wonder Princess! movie was an utterly shameless rip-off of DCs iconic Wonder Woman character, the fact that Pixie Pinkie was obviously imitating The Fairly OddParents, and the fact that even the great 1980s classic ThunderCats was just taking the Masters of the Universe template and making a few tweaks. We hope you enjoy it!

That is, until John Wick rolled around in 2014. This action-packed shooter with a simple plot became a surprise hit and introduced the world to some awesome gun-fu action.\n\nThe movie does raise a few questions though! Like how did they manage to get the producers to get off their back about worldbuilding details and love interests? How does anyone feel safe at the Continental Hotel? Why didn’t Viggo stick around to make sure his men took care of John Wick, and why did John make a deal with Viggo just moments later? Also, why didn’t anyone Google Baba Yaga?\n\nTo answer all these questions and more, step inside the pitch meeting that led to John Wick! It’ll be super easy, barely an inconvenience.\n\n\nCheck Out These Other Amazing Videos:\n\nThe Matrix Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQvjl-Z_V6s\n\nGame of Thrones Season 8 Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAhKOV3nImQ\n\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/",

                "description": "Подпишитесь на наш канал: http://bit.ly/SR-Russia-Subscribe\n\nСейчас, кажется, что актеры киновселенной Marvel были просто рождены для своих ролей, однако, зачастую, их путь к успеху был не так прост. Сегодня мы поговорим о том, какой была их жизнь до того, как они попали в Marvel. Перед тем, как он получил роль Вижена, Полу Беттани сказали, что он никогда больше не сыграет в кино. Джош Бролин почти отказался от роли Таноса, пока не нашел вдохновение в довольно неожиданном месте. Удивительно, но с Элизабет Олсен и Зои Салданой произошли вещи, которые едва не заставили их окончательно уйти из шоу-бизнеса, прежде чем они стали частью киновселенной Marvel. В то время, как над Томом Холландом часто смеялись из-за его танцевальных навыков, они, в конечном итоге, помогли ему сыграть роль нашего дружелюбного соседа, Человека-паука. Том Хиддлстон, на самом деле, пробовался на роль другого персонажа, прежде чем стать Локи, а Крис Хемсворт сам называл свою актерскую карьеру «весьма спорной» до того, как получил роль Тора. Мы также расскажем о неожиданной причине, по которой Крис Эванс отказывался от роли Капитана Америки не один, а целых три раза.\n\nСейчас трудно себе представить других актеров в образах наших любимых героев комиксов, но, как вы считаете правильно ли был подобран актерский состав? Вы бы заменили кого-то из них, если бы у вас была такая возможность? Расскажите нам в разделе комментариев. А также не забудьте подписаться на наш канал, чтобы всегда оставаться в курсе новинок.",

                "description": "These Disney theories will blow your mind.\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant\n\nWelcome back, ScreenRanters! During this weird time, we’re glad to aid with some kind of entertainment. Disney is one of the biggest powerhouses in film, television, merchandise, and whatnot. As they’ve been around for decades, each of us has been influenced by the House Of Mouse at some point. With that, many fans of Disney have resorted to creating theories based on their animated films. Some of which sound like crazy nonsense. Yet when you really examine what the theory is, it makes so much sense! Today, that’s exactly what we’re going to take a gander at. Some of the strangest and best theories about Disney films.\n\nNow for the customary spoiler warning about what’s in the video. If you don’t want to know, then we suggest you watch the video now and make all your contacts do the same. Firstly, we have the Pixar classic, Toy Story, and who Jessie’s former owner, Emily, really is! We also have a Frozen tale that connects Anna, Elsa, Tarzan, and Tangled’s Rapunzel. We also came across a dark idea involving Carl and Russell from Up. There’s the insane argument that connects Boo from Monsters Inc with the Witch from Brave! It involves Sully, or “Kitty”, if you’re being informal. We also have a tale connecting The Little Mermaid and Peter Pan. It involves Ariel’s mother! If you liked Inside Out, then you’ll love the relationship that Bing Bong may have with another franchise! There’s also the terrifying tale in The Emperor's New Groove with Kuzco that may disturb you like it did us. We also have an idea about the bleak landscape in Aladdin. The Genie plays a big part in this. We also have crazy theories involving Snow White and Finding Nemo! \n\nFeaturing: \n\nEntry 1 : Prince Of Afterlife \nEntry 2 : Boo In Time\nEntry 3 : Ariel’s Pan-tastic Time\nEntry 4 : Aladdin Mad Max\nEntry 5 : Finding Nothing\nEntry 6 : Bing Bong Lives!\nEntry 7 : Up Angel\nEntry 8 : Who Is Jessie’s Emily?\nEntry 9 : The Emperor’s New Trauma\nEntry 10 : Keeping It In The Family\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/",

Why doesn’t anything seem to have lasting consequences? What’s a force dyad? How can Rey suddenly heal everybody now? Is this a video game? Who did Emperor Palpatine make a baby with? Why can’t we stop picturing it?!!\n\nTo answer all these questions and more, step inside the pitch meeting that led to the Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker!\n\n\nCheck Out These Other Amazing Videos:\n\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v2PV52WNLY\n\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8Z7ECooXsQ\n\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\nhttps://plus.google.com/+ScreenRant\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/",

Which, if true, could lead to some pretty interesting things in the future, including the Sinister Six film that Sony has been wanting to get off the ground for years at this point.\n\nSo in this video, I’m gonna take a look at this rumor, how the current state of Spider-Man’s movie rights could affect things, and what it \ncould mean for the future of Spider-Man.\n\nAlso, even though this is just rumor and speculation right now, I’m gonna throw up a potential spoiler warning for Venom 2.

                "description": "These heroes were the cause of the villains they had to fight.\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant\n\nSuperheroes essentially have two jobs: stop the bad guys and don’t die in the process. They haven’t exactly followed these thumb rules to the T. \n\nSuperheroes epitomise the notion of perfection and prowess. Their character arcs have evolved with time to encompass more qualities than the goodness-courage and strength trifecta, adding more layers to superhero narratives- in which the villains might not be abjectly evil. That said, the average superhero too isn’t flawless. This video explores some iconic villains that superhero movie franchises have introduced over the years and they all have one thing in common: they were created as a direct or indirect result of the superheroes’ oeuvre. \n\nCriminals are not created in a void. Movies like Black Panther and Megamind reflect a growing trend of mainstream movies warming up to sensitive topics and question whether the showmanship and hubris of a hero should be taken at face value. In TV lore, on the other hand, villains like Captain represent what happens when a hero asserts his place in a criminal milieu. Then there's also the rare antagonist who was created by accident, like Dr. Doom or The Red Hood. These origin stories call attention to the complex nature of superhero narratives and the dynamic relationships they entail. They also speak to the fact that antagonists and anti-heroes can have their own heartening stories-sometimes all they needed was a little empathy and kindness. \n\nCheck out the Behind The Screen Podcast - By Screen Rant on Spotify!\nhttps://open.spotify.com/show/6sMJkP1E4N7kPYL5v9OW3v\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/screen-rant/\n\nOur Website:\nhttp://screenrant.com/\n\nWritten by: Roma Mandpe\nNarrated by: CJ\nEdited by: James Hicks\n\nFor copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com",

And rightly so. Ever since it’s release in 2005, it has continued to entertain and mystify us, with it’s own popular spinoff show, The Legend of Korra, and the less popular movie adaptation by M Night Shyamalan, as well as a plethora of other material, from comics to wiki pages. It’s fans are some of the most passionate with hot debates about which nation they would belong to or who the best character on the show is. \n\nBut even the best shows have their faults. That’s right, even television royalty like Avatar has it’s plot holes, unexplained questions and foibles, showing like everything it is fallible. In this video we will look into some of these glaring mistakes and wonder how we missed them the first time around. This will include loosely defined lore and world building, bizarre character choices and questionable morality. These takes will be hotter than Zuko’s temper and Iroh’s cup of tea. \n\nSo sit back and relax and take a trip back through the world of Avatar: The Last Airbender. And don’t forget- SPOILERS INCOMING!\n\nWhat do you think of the plot holes? How does Avatar rank in your all time favourite TV shows? Were there any we missed?

                "description": "We had some unsettling realizations about Harry Potter...\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant\n\nJK Rowling might be in the news these days for her controversial opinions, but there’s no stopping the fact that Harry Potter is still one of the biggest phenomenons in the entire world. The books had an enormous effect on millions of kids everywhere, and the true Potter fans are still totally obsessed. And yet, even though we will always love the books, we can’t help but notice some seriously weird things about them that we never picked up on the first time around. It turns out that the Wizarding World is a bit of a dark and twisted place after all! \nEven though we’d still love to go there to study magic, Hogwarts itself has a lot of backwards traditions! Like the Sorting Hat, for instance. Only now did we realize that sorting a bunch of children based on personalities that haven’t even developed yet is a pretty questionable practice! Or how about the teachers? Sure, some are amazing, but they really did let a ton of weirdos take on teaching jobs over the years. Not to mention one who was literally hiding Voldemort on the back of his head. Did no one screen these people? Apparently not! Outside of Hogwarts there is the very corrupt Ministry of Magic, the fact that people still use and sell love potions, Dementors floating around all over the place, and the horrifying reality of House Elves! All of these things and so many more really make us question just what is going on in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter.

Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6\n\nCheck Out These Other Amazing Videos:\n10 Times Disney Ripped Off Other Films https://youtu.be/VhjDaCCyc50\n10 Upcoming DC Movies That Could Push Them Ahead Of Marvel\nhttps://youtu.be/aIZrMiovoxo\n\nWhen watching a movie, characters can often be broken down into different character categories. This includes the hero, villain, and supporting role. But when movies are truly analyzed, it’s not as simple as it seems. Many viewers love to break down movie plots, figure out stories, and discover some crazy things that no one never realized.\n\nFor example, The Beast may have been tortured for a bad decision, but there is a lot more that made him a monster – including a son he never acknowledges. In the movie “Grease”, we follow the epic love story of Danny and Sandy, but what if Sandy was dead the whole time and Danny was the one that murdered her?! In the Lion King, we all know how evil Scar is, but a deleted song from the film dives deeper into his disturbed methods and ideas. In, Mrs. Doubtfire, it’s all very funny when Robin Williams dresses as an old nanny, but her evil motives showcase the true monster behind the mask. Kevin from Home Alone used a lot of creativity to create the traps for Marv and Harry, but he may have taken his moral punishments one step too far. On the Rugrats, Angelica may be one of the only living babies, creating a crazy paradox with thoughtless parents. Wizard of Oz seems like a fairly simple story that involves good witches and bad witches, but there are some monstrous secrets that Glinda the Good Witch may be hiding. Wall-E is a great futuristic story about human civilization, but what is real story about the humans looking for another food source as they await their future on space stations?! Peter Pan loves his life on Neverland, but it may be a little too much and have led him to murders on multiple occasions. Doc in Back to the Future is not just a kooky scientist. He’s a criminal, terrorist, and attempted murderer!\n\nScript by: Alan Donahue\n\nVoice Over by: Benjamin Harris\n\nEdited by: Martin Baena\n\nFeaturing:\nThe Beast's Secret Child | 0:30 \nDanny Drowned Sandy | 1:38\nThe Lion Pack Dishonors Nala | 2:39\nMrs. Doubtfire | 3:41 \nKevin From Home Alone | 4:44\nAngelica's Crazy Childhood | 5:46\nGlinda The Good Witch | 6:47\nWall-E And The Cannibals | 7:43\nPeter Pan The Murderer | 8:50\nDoc From Back To The Future | 9:55\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\nhttps://plus.google.com/+ScreenRant\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/",

                "description": "These actors didn't make a lot of money for these major roles.\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant\n\nOne of the benefits of being a big Hollywood actor are those sweet, sweet paychecks. So you might be surprised to learn how many major movie stars have taken serious pay cuts for various reasons. Matthew McConaughey went from doing romantic comedies to winning Academy Awards and all it cost him was a few million bucks! Chris Evans was named a great value actor for his work as Captain America, and Gal Gadon only took home a six figure pay check for taking on the role of Wonder Woman. Jonah Hill was so eager to take part in The Wolf of Wall Street that he accepted very little income, and unfortunately the project ended up costing him a lot. When Kristen Stewart was making that Twilight money, she signed onto a way smaller budget and chose not to walk away when the budget was cut. It turns out Harrison Ford made way more money reprising his role of Han Solo than he did in A New Hope, and Jennifer Aniston sacrificed her bank account balance out of solidarity with her fellow sitcom stars. \n\nWhat do you think about actors who took a paycut for their passion projects?

                "description": "What kind of dark secrets are the Minions hiding? Subscribe to our channel for more awesome videos: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant\n\nThe Minions are everywhere these days, thanks to the success of the Despicable Me films and their own solo adventure which hit theatres in 2016. But despite how popular they are, what do audiences really know about them? Aside from the obvious, there’s actually a whole bunch of information out there. For instance, the original minions were designed in part with the Jawas from Star Wars and the Oompa Loompas from Willy Wonka in mind. But that was after they decided to scrap the orc design. Yup, Minions were originally going to look more like an orc out of Warcraft or the Lord of the Rings films. The Minions have their own evil counterparts too, who are quite literally on the other side of the color spectrum. Unlike original Minions, which evolved over time from a single celled organism, the purple minions were engineered to do their minion duties without fail. Oh, and be bad guys while they’re at it. There are actually 10400 different minions on the poster for Despicable Me 2, all of them unique. That’s a lot of unique variations. But the method behind making them is actually pretty easy thanks to the help of some pre-determined templates. That’s why some Minions look so alike but in actuality, none of them are 100% the same. Oh-and the Minions can actually survive in space. Apparently, their antics would put them in so much harm that they needed to ensure the survival of their species, even in the vacuum of space.\n\nScript by: Sean Gallagher\n\nVoice Over by: Joseph Delaney\n\nEdited by: Hugo Alves\n\nFeaturing:\nOne Minion To Rule Them All | 0:38 \nMinions, Lots of Minions | 1:43\nNot All Minions Are Good | 2:50\nMinion Speak Is Actually A Language | 3:55 \nDo The Evolution | 5:05\nFrom Orc To Minion | 6:09\nMinion Designs Were Inspired By... | 7:16\nThe Color Of Evil | 8:28\nOne Small Step | 9:36\nMinions Were Created By Nazis | 10:41\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\nhttps://plus.google.com/+ScreenRant\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/",

                "description": "They may technically be owned by the same company, but there's still a huge difference between Disney and Pixar movies! Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/ho3Hg6\n\nCheck out \"10 Shocking Disney Pixar Theories That Actually Make Sense\" from our friends at CBR: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0r87Bf3OTc\n\nPixar is Disney’s baby they began taking care of in 2006. Since then, the word has flown around the industry that Pixar made Disney better when their head chief creative officer, John Lasseter, went over to help Disney. But it was also said that Pixar suffered and reverted to more sequels, however, their sequels turned out to be just as good as the originals. Take “Finding Dory” or “Toy Story 2” for examples.\n\nDespite Disney buying the major animation studio, Pixar still isn’t afraid to say no to them. Pixar has a core Brain Trust that all their ideas go through and they won’t be compromising any of their stories for a “Mulan,” “Aladdin,” or “Frozen” style film. Instead, Pixar is going to continue making outside the box, conflict-driven, flawed character leading films such as “Up,” “Wall-E,” “Toy Story,” “Inside Out,” “The Incredibles,” \"Brave,\" \"Cars,\" and “Monsters Inc.” Not to mention that both the major studios take time to make cool little short films before their actual features, but Disney can’t even hold a candle to Pixar’s originality in those.\n\nSo what has made Pixar so consistently successful over the years? Is it their small, closed group of in-house writers? Is it the time they take for the proper story, like the ten years it took “The Incredible 2” to be made? Is it their knowledge that Chinese food creates conflict? Is it their no-fear at tackling new worlds like that of “Coco”? It’s all these things and way more! Watch this video to discover all the crazy, fearless, and risk-taking things that Pixar does that Disney would NEVER do! You’ll be shocked at the differences and thrilled to watch the newest Pixar film!\n\nCheck out these other awesome videos!\n\n10 Animated Movies That Were Changed In Other Countries\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LhQ7quaZy4\n\n10 Theories About Nickelodeon Shows That Will Ruin Your Childhood\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ16Le1DhjI\n\nSource article by: Sergio Solorzano, The Gamer \nLink: https://www.thegamer.com/things-pixar-disney-different-facts/\n\nOur Social Media:\nhttps://twitter.com/screenrant\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRant\nhttps://plus.google.com/+ScreenRant\n\nOur Website\nhttp://screenrant.com/",

                "description": "Hilarious scenes you had no idea were actually bloopers!\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant\n\nAlthough bloopers can make a humorous  reel during the credits, sometimes a blooper is so perfect that it summarizes the entire movie. So much so that when the movie hits the editing floor they make it into the final cut. In fact bloopers can go so unnoticed that they look like they were scripted making them so much more than just an outtake.\n\nIn this video we will look at some of the best bloopers that made it into the final cut and how they helped shape and even sometimes improve the movies they were in.  This video will feature actors dropping precious props in a Marvel movie, to smashing priceless antiques in a western as well some famous actors getting some painful injuries from bruised faces to broken bones. We will also look at some great one liners and moments of forced improv- including a brilliant one liner in the Fast and the Furious series. \n\nOne of the toughest parts of bloopers can be keeping a straight face with a lot of the actors having to try and stay in character, doing all they can to keep a scene moving- even if you're bleeding or falling down to the ground.\n\nWhich was your favourite blooper? Which one were you most surprised by? Were there any big ones we missed?

Not only are there real pilots on board, including Tom Cruise, but they’re also stocked with IMAX cameras capable of filming in 6K! Director Joseph Kosinski admitted the training process was grueling but that’s what it takes to pull off some of these extreme stunts! Jennifer Connelly loved being part of the cast even though she was intimidated by one of her co-stars, and Jerry Bruckheimer says technological advancements allowed him to create a sequel he could have only dreamed about when the first film was released. \n\nWhat do you think about the follow up to this fan-favorite film? Are you excited to see some high flying, hi definition action or do you prefer to leave the past in the past and remember the first film how it was?

Puede que fuera por obligaciones contractuales, problemas personales o simplemente al hecho de tener que audicionar. Por ello, los ejecutivos elaboraron listas alternativas para los roles en las películas. Podríamos haber tenido un elenco muy, muy diferente que asumieran estos papeles de superhéroes. Hoy, vamos a echar un vistazo a qué actores podrían haber interpretado qué personajes.\n\nVeremos a ver a los posibles actores del Capitán América. ¿Qué papel podría interpretar Channing Tatum? ¡Además de su conexión a los Cuatro Fantásticos, John Krasinski y Emily Blunt también estaban vinculados a otros grandes roles! También veremos a la Viuda Negra. Que podría haber involucrado a Angelina Jolie. Tenemos a Hulk, que podría haber sido interpretado por El Guasón, Joaquin Phoenix. Hablando de este personaje, Jared Leto casi que estuvo en el UCM. ¿Fue por Doctor Strange? ¡Tal vez! ¿Para qué personaje se consideró a Triple H de WWE? ¡Mira para enterarte! El actor de Blade, Wesley Snipes, podría haber sido un personaje de Marvel en los años 90. ¡El ícono de Star Wars, Ewan McGregor, también está en la lista! Además de esto, ¡veremos quién podría haber sido Iron Man, Spider-Man y muchos más personajes!",
