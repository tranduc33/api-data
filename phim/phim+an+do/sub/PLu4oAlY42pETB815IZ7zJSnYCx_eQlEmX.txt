                "description": "Hi Guys! \nA lot of you ask me what specialty I chose. I wanted to make a video to share my long journey deciding on a medical specialty. This video makes it look a little easier than it actually was to deciding theeee specialty. It also doesn't explain every single reason because I didn't want to make it too long. I am really excited to learn more about this field and be the best doctor I can be. I have been learning more about the importance and how I can contribute to this specialty. Going through medical school is difficult! When you finally near the end and you have to decide what you want to specialize in, you want to choose a specialty that was all well worth all that trouble!!

I enjoy providing prenatal care to expectant mothers in a traditional care model as well as in a group care model (CenteringPregnancy). I also specialize in general gynecology including cervical pap smear screening, abnormal menstrual bleeding, contraception, and management of menopausal symptoms. I was born in Chicago, Illinois and moved to Mobile, Alabama at the age of 10 where I spent the rest of my childhood and eventual higher education. I attended the University of South Alabama both for my undergraduate and doctorate degrees. I met my husband while attending medical school, and we traveled to Gainesville, FL together to complete our residency training at the University of Florida. Outside of work, my husband and I enjoy traveling, Orangetheory Fitness, and playing with our two little dogs.",

Get to know him in this video and learn more at https://www.dukehealth.org/find-doctors-physicians/alejandro-landa-md\n\nAbout Dr. Landa\n\nI became an OB-GYN because this specialty allows me to form close bonds with my patients. As obstetricians and gynecologists, we are trusted with intimate secrets, and we are responsible for taking care of our patients and protecting them when they are most vulnerable. I provide minimally invasive procedures, such as laparoscopy, hysteroscopy, endometrial ablations, LEEP, laser, and colposcopy to treat a variety of conditions, such as fibroids, endometriosis, abnormal uterine bleeding, vulvar lesions, abnormal pap smears, ovarian cysts, and infertility. I have the privilege of helping someone start a family and participating in one of life's most wonderful moments: the celebration of a newborn. The most gratifying part of my job is knowing that I have helped someone start a family, that I was able to care for a woman in a time of difficulty, and that I have helped the rest of her family by helping her.",

                "description": "Believe it or not, the most important part of medical school, other than getting through it, is choosing a specialty which is right for you. Unfortunately, most medical students are not aware of all of their options.  \n\nFor example, few physicians know what the field of Pathology is about.  In addition, many physicians will either leave a specialty / train in multiple specialties because they never appreciated all of their options.  \n\nAnother recurring story is that medical students will only apply to the Dermatology Specialty - but they are not accepted into the field - because it is so competitive.  These students should have known that Dermatology is probably the most competitive medical specialty in the United States, and that elite students are denied entry into this field every year.  These sort of mistakes will only hurt YOU, and they happen far to often.  \n\nFor the most part, physician specialties attract a certain personality - just like any other profession.  So, learn about these specialties NOW.  Then, follow / shadow physicians in your field of interest.  You will LIKELY need to use your WEEKEND TIME or your VACATION days to do so.  Do not under-estimate the importance of choosing the right field... or you could regret it for the rest of your career. \n    \nCorrections / Clarifications:\n\n4:07 Internists tend to be under-paid and under-appreciated.\nHowever, when internists sub-specialize (ex. cardiology), then they can get paid significantly more and get more respect.\n\n7:01 I am trying to communicate how female organs tend to have more malignant forms of cancer, unlike that of male organs.\nMale organs: Penile cancer (very rare), Prostate cancer (common, but is not very lethal)\nFemale organs: Breast cancer (common and lethal), Uterine / Cervical / Ovarian cancer (more lethal than prostate cancer)\n\n12:18 Residency is specialty training\nFellowship is sub-specialty training\n\n12:35 after STEP 2CK, it should say \"STEP 2CS\"",
