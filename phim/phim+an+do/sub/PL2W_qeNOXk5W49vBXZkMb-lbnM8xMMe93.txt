                "description": "What Should You Do If You're Bitten by a Venomous Snake?\n     There is a story taking place in Northern India, with episodes similar to the classic love story Romeo and Juliet. But the story changed last minute, the Indian version of Juliet is still alive. According to Gulf News, Shankar Rai, who lived in Northern India, was bitten by a venomous snake when sleeping at home. The next morning, feeling he would not pass, Shankar spoke to his wife, said his last wish was that the couple die at the same time, the same day together. When the wife agreed, Shankar bit his wife's wrist. Not long after, both spouses lost consciousness. Both were discovered shortly afterwards and quickly taken to the hospital. Unfortunately, when they were taken to the hospital, Shankar had died, and his wife was still alive and saved. When partially recovering, the wife said, before biting his wife's wrist, Mr. Shankar confided a lot, saying that because he loved his wife so much, did not want the yin and yang separated, he wanted the couple to die together. Moved by her husband's affection, she allowed her husband to bite her. Currently, she feels very sad because she is still alive but her husband is no more.\nsubscriber:https://bitly.com.vn/cBaat\nPage: https://bom.to/aUpDEN\n#Art_Life Experience #Life Experience",

The act was enacted in 1974 as a part of the larger Consumer Credit Protection Act (CCPA). The Equal Opportunity Credit Act amends the CCPA by prohibiting discrimination at any level of the lending process. Creditors can still ask lenders to provide certain personal information, but under the act they cannot use that information to decide whether to extend a loan or to decide what the terms of any resulting loan will be.",

Underneath this law credit discrimination is forbidden. Creditors cannot accept or deny an application based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or because you receive public assistance. They are allowed to ask for this information, but it can not be used to make a decision. The most common deciding factors for a credit application are things like income, debt, and credit history.\n\nhttp://nationalcreditfederation.com/credit-u/ecoa\nThis law covers any business or organization that extends credit. This includes but is not limited to banks, small loan and finance companies, retail and department stores, credit card companies, and credit unions. Everyone involved with the provision of credit, or decision of the terms, must comply with ECOA.",

But the biggest hurdle to the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) lies in how well this so-called black box technology can be governed and controlled. In this video, Andrew Burt, chief privacy officer and legal engineer at Immuta, suggests a framework for how artificial intelligence can be created, tested, and deployed ethically—and how its benefits can be harnessed fully in medicine and beyond.",

                "title": "Financial Services Industry: Restructuring & Integrating Banks and Deposit Insurance Reform (1987)",
                "description": "The United States was the second country (after Czechoslovakia)[7] to officially enact deposit insurance to protect depositors from losses by insolvent banks. In 1933 the Glass–Steagall Act established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to insure deposits at commercial banks.\n\nIn 1970 Congress established a separate fund for credit unions, the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. The NCUSIF insures all federally chartered credit unions and many state-chartered credit unions (98% as of 2009).[8] Some others are insured by the private guaranty corporation American Share Insurance (156 as of 2009).[8] In 1978 foreign banks operating in the United States were required to hold the same level of reserves under the specifications of the International Banking Act.[9][10]\n\nIn 1934, Congress created the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation to insure savings and loan deposits. In the 1980s, during the savings and loan crisis, the FSLIC became insolvent and was abolished; its responsibility was transferred to the FDIC.\n\nSome financial institutions offer insurance in excess of FDIC or NCUA limits. For example, the Depositors Insurance Fund insures excess deposits at Massachusetts-chartered savings banks. American Share Insurance provides excess share insurance at participating credit unions.\n\nThe Truth in Savings Act (TISA), implemented by Regulation DD, established uniformity in disclosing terms and conditions regarding interest and fees when giving out information and when opening a new savings account. On passing the law in 1991, Congress noted it would help promote economic stability, competition between depository institutions, and allow the consumer to make informed decisions.\n\nThe Expedited Funds Availability Act (EFAA) of 1987, implemented by Regulation CC, defines when standard holds and exception holds can be placed on checks deposited to checking accounts, and the maximum length of time the money can be held. A bank's hold policy can be less stringent than the guidelines provided, but it cannot exceed the guidelines.\n\nThe Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978, implemented by Regulation E, established the rights and liabilities of consumers as well as the responsibilities of all participants in electronic funds transfer activities.\n\nThe Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) of 1975, implemented by Regulation C, requires financial institutions to maintain and annually disclose data about home purchases, home purchase pre-approvals, home improvement, and refinance applications involving one- to four-unit and multifamily dwellings. It also requires branches and loan centers to display a HMDA poster.\n\nThe Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) of 1974, implemented by Regulation B, requires creditors which regularly extend credit to customers—including banks, retailers, finance companies, and bank-card companies—to evaluate candidates on creditworthiness alone, rather than other factors such as race, color, religion, national origin, or sex. Discrimination based on marital status, receipt of public assistance, and age is generally prohibited (with exceptions), as is discrimination based on a consumer's good-faith exercise of his or her credit-protection rights.\n\nThe Truth in Lending Act (TILA) of 1968, implemented by Regulation Z, promotes the informed use of consumer credit by standardizing the disclosure of interest rates and other costs associated with borrowing. TILA also gives consumers the right to cancel certain credit transactions involving a lien on the consumer's principal dwelling, regulates certain credit-card practices, and provides a means of resolving credit-billing disputes.\n\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) of 1970 regulates the collection, sharing, and use of customer-credit information. The act allows consumers to obtain a copy of their credit report from credit bureaus that hold information on them, provides for consumers to dispute negative information held and sets time limits, after which negative information is suppressed. It requires that consumers be informed when negative information is added to their credit records, and when adverse action is taken based on a credit report.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_regulation_in_the_United_States#Deposit_insurance",
