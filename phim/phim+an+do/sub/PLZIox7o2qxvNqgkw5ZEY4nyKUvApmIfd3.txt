                "description": "#HindiMovies2019 #HindiDubbedMovies2019 #BollywoodMovies2019 #Prabhas\n\nSouth Indian Movies Dubbed in Hindi Full Movie 2019 New : Bujji (Prabhas) and Chitti (Trisha Krishnan) are inseparable childhood friends. But when Bujji crashes Chitti's sandcastle by mistake, Chitti gets angry and asks Bujji not to meet her for 12 years. She does, however, promise to marry him at the end of the lengthy hiatus, leaving Bujji but a glimmer of hope. After half-heartedly agreeing to her harsh terms, the forlorn Bujji leaves home, the pain of living in Visakhapatnam without seeing Chitti too much to bear. He winds up in Chennai, hence the tagline, Made in Chennai.He spends those dozen years in Chennai presumably like a 'goonda', as he is shown beating up people. Also, he spouts Tamil dialogues now and then, and is a great fan of Rajnikanth.\n\nWhen Bujji returns after 12 years, he foolishly beats up cops in mufti, and lands in jail. In jail, he encounters the sons of Machi Reddy (Kota Srinivasa Rao), who give him Rs 1,00,00,000 to finish off Sivanna (Mohan Babu). But when Bujji tires to kill Sivanna, he is injured. Sivanna lets him stay at his house and uses him as his henchman. Only then does he learn that his long lost love, Chitti, is Sivanna's sister. Chitti is studying in London and her family is living in Hyderabad. She sends her sister Sanjana to contact Bujji. Bujji disguises his name as Rajini Kanth when he is treated there. Sivanna learns that his actual name is Bujji, but he asks him not to tell Chitti, because he is scared she might never want to see him again, since he was responsible for his wife's death. When Machi Reddy learns that he is part of Sivanna's gang, his son shoots Chitti and kidnaps Sanjana, and says to switch her for Sivanna . Chitti sends Bujji to save Sivanna.Bujji thrashehs the goons and kill all.Chitti gets saved and reunites with Bujji and lives with Sivanna.",

                "description": "#HindiMovies2019 #HindiDubbedMovies2019 #BollywoodMovies2019 #Prabhas #TrishaKrishnan\n\nDEEWAR - Man of Power (Bujjigadu) in which Bujji (Prabhas) and Chitti (Trisha) are best buddies during their childhood. At the age of 11, Chitti develops some differences with Bujji and says that she will not meet him for the next 12 years. Bujji packs his bags and runaways to Chennai. He returns to AP after 12 years in search of Chitti. The rest of the story is all about how they meet each other.\n\nFor Latest Updates, follow us on\n\nFacebook\nhttp://www.facebook.com/bollykick\n\nG +\nhttp://www.google.com/+bollykick\n\nTwitter\nhttp://www.twitter.com/bollykick\n\nBujji (Prabhas) and Chitti (Trisha Krishnan) are inseparable childhood friends. But when Bujji crashes Chitti's sandcastle by mistake, Chitti gets angry and asks Bujji not to meet her for 12 years. She does, however, promise to marry him at the end of the lengthy hiatus, leaving Bujji but a glimmer of hope. After half-heartedly agreeing to her harsh terms, the forlorn Bujji leaves home, the pain of living in Visakhapatnam without seeing Chitti too much to bear. He winds up in Chennai, hence the tagline, Made in Chennai.\n\nHe spends those dozen years in Chennai presumably like a 'goonda', as he is shown beating up people. Also, he spouts Tamil dialogues now and then, and is a great fan of Rajnikanth.\n\nWhen Bujji returns after 12 years, he foolishly beats up cops in mufti, and lands in jail. In jail, he encounters the sons of Machi Reddy (Kota Srinivasa Rao), who give him Rs 1,00,00,000 to finish off Sivanna (Mohan Babu). But when Bujji tires to kill Sivanna, he is injured. Sivanna lets him stay at his house and uses him as his henchman. Only then does he learn that his long lost love, Chitti, is Sivanna's sister. Chitti is studying in London and her family is living in Hyderabad. She sends her sister Sanjana to contact Bujji. Bujji disguises his name as Rajini Kanth when he is treated there. Sivanna learns that his actual name is Bujji, but he asks him not to tell Chitti, because he is scared she might never want to see him again, since he was responsible for his wife's death. When Machi Reddy learns that he is part of Sivanna's gang, his son shoots Chitti and kidnaps Sanjana, and says to switch her for Sivanna . Chitti sends Bujji to save Sivanna.Bujji thrashehs the goons and kill all.Chitti gets saved and reunites with Bujji and lives with Sivanna.",

At the same time Shailaja catches the eye of Bhadranna (Gopichand), a gangster who also becomes infatuated with her. Venkat keeps bumping into Sailaja coincidentally every time it rains and they fall in love. Ranga Rao (Prakash Raj), Sailaja's dad, is a typical black sheep with all kinds of bad habits. Bhadranna approaches him with the marriage proposal and Ranga Rao jumps on that and immediately agrees. Later, a film producer approaches him with an offer for Shailaja to act in a movie. Ranga Rao thinks that acting in films would be more lucrative than marrying her off to Bhadranna. He first successfully creates clashes between lovers and convinces Shailaja to act in a movie and leaves with her to the city. Venkat also leaves for Vizag to his uncle's place.\n\nInfuriated Bhadranna kidnaps Shailaja from a shooting spot and tries to change her mind about marrying him. Movie producer gets tensed as shooting was paused and Ranga Rao advises him to approach Venkat as he believes Venkat still loves Shailaja. Venkat agrees and fights with Bhadranna for Shailaja.
