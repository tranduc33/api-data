There’s an atmosphere of complete festivity as the Naag log (snake men) get together to watch the show made on them. However, when they watch the show, they’re completely disheartened! They realize that they’re viewed in extremely bad light on Earth! They’re viewed as negative, vengeful creatures who are only out to hurt Earthlings! The Naag log decide that they must come up with way to change the Earthlings perceptions about them. While one group feels that the Earthlings must be punished for portraying the Naag log in such a poor light, another believes that perhaps, there might be a more peaceful to go about this. Perhaps one of them needs to go to Earth and change the perceptions of the Earthlings about the Naag log!

Sanskar tries to explain to her that it is not so, but in vain. Swara tells him that she will end all relation with him till the time Lakshya returns back home. Meanwhile, Ragini asks Shekhar to take her along as this place would keep on reminding her about Lakshya and she cannot live without her husband, Swara and Ragini leave along with Shekhar and Sharmishtha. Sanskar tries to stop Swara, saying that if she steps out of the house he would end all relations with her, but Swara leaves nonetheless. Stay tuned to find out what happens next.\n\nTo go to the show playlist go to : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcC6hSpO26Ku4Bk_QrL_xZ6Bz_wmowMQd\n\nThe accuracy, completeness, currency and/or suitability of the above video description is not endorsed by its licensor or broadcaster or the Channel.
