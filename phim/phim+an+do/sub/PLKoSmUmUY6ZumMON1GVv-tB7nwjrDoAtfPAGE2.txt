A combination of ‘emotions’ and ‘variety’, COLORS offers an entire spectrum of emotions to its viewers.\n\n\"Everybody sits down for breakfast and seeing Maitalee serve food, Myrah asks her why is she serving food. Mohini tells Myrah that it has been the practice always of this house. But Myrah asks everyone that whether they have a problem to serve themselves, and everyone says that they have no problem to serve themselves. Mohini is not able to digest this and walks away. Later, Maitalee asks Myrah to stop troubling Mohini but Myrah refuses to do so. Mohini hears Maitalee trying to convince Myrah by showing the better side of Mohini, and she is moved to tears. That night, Maitalee's adopted daughter keeps crying continuously and everyone is trying to quieten her. Mohini comes there and taking the little one from Maitalee's hands, scolds Maitalee for making her wear new clothes which are stiff for babies.
