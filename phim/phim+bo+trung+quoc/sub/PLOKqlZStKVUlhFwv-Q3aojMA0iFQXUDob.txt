                "description": "What Should You Do If You're Bitten by a Venomous Snake?\n     There is a story taking place in Northern India, with episodes similar to the classic love story Romeo and Juliet. But the story changed last minute, the Indian version of Juliet is still alive. According to Gulf News, Shankar Rai, who lived in Northern India, was bitten by a venomous snake when sleeping at home. The next morning, feeling he would not pass, Shankar spoke to his wife, said his last wish was that the couple die at the same time, the same day together. When the wife agreed, Shankar bit his wife's wrist. Not long after, both spouses lost consciousness. Both were discovered shortly afterwards and quickly taken to the hospital. Unfortunately, when they were taken to the hospital, Shankar had died, and his wife was still alive and saved. When partially recovering, the wife said, before biting his wife's wrist, Mr. Shankar confided a lot, saying that because he loved his wife so much, did not want the yin and yang separated, he wanted the couple to die together. Moved by her husband's affection, she allowed her husband to bite her. Currently, she feels very sad because she is still alive but her husband is no more.\nsubscriber:https://bitly.com.vn/cBaat\nPage: https://bom.to/aUpDEN\n#Art_Life Experience #Life Experience",

                "description": "In a classic research-based TEDx Talk, Dr. Lara Boyd describes how neuroplasticity gives you the power to shape the brain you want. Recorded at TEDxVancouver at Rogers Arena on November 14, 2015.\n\nYouTube Tags: brain science, brain, stroke, neuroplasticity, science, motor learning, identity, TED, TEDxVancouver, TEDxVancouver 2015, Vancouver, TEDx, Rogers Arena, Vancouver speakers, Vancouver conference, ideas worth spreading, great idea,\n\nOur knowledge of the brain is evolving at a breathtaking pace, and Dr. Lara Boyd is positioned at the cutting edge of these discoveries. In 2006, she was recruited by the University of British Columbia to become the Canada Research Chair in Neurobiology and Motor Learning. Since that time she has established the Brain Behaviour Lab, recruited and trained over 40 graduate students, published more than 80 papers and been awarded over $5 million in funding. \n\nDr. Boyd’s efforts are leading to the development of novel, and more effective, therapeutics for individuals with brain damage, but they are also shedding light on broader applications. By learning new concepts, taking advantage of opportunities, and participating in new activities, you are physically changing who you are, and opening up a world of endless possibility. \n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

                "description": "After a nanny hired to care for a Florida family sexually assaulted their 11-year-old son and gave birth to his baby, the boy was left to reveal the abuse and the secret the nanny had kept to his mother. Last month, Marissa Mowry, 28, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for sexually assaulting Chris McBride when he was just 11. She gave birth to his child in October 2014. Chris spoke to Inside Edition about how Mowry, who lived with the family while working as their nanny, groomed him.",

So the big deal is, of course, the right to vote women gained when the 19th amendment was passed and ratified. But women made a lot of other gains in the 30 years between 1890 and 1920. More women joined the workforce, they acquired lots of other legal rights related to property, and they also became key consumers in the industrial economy. Women also continued to play a vital role in reform movements. Sadly, they got Prohibition enacted in the US, but they did a lot of good stuff, too. The field of social work emerged as women like Jane Addams created settlement houses to assist immigrants in their integration into the United States. Women also began to work to make birth control widely available. You'll learn about famous reformers and activists like Alice Paul, Margaret Sanger, and Emma Goldman, among others.\n\nHey teachers and students - Check out CommonLit's free collection of reading passages and curriculum resources to learn more about the events of this episode. Suffragists faced a decades-long debate on women’s right to vote: https://www.commonlit.org/texts/address-to-congress-on-women-s-suffrage\nWhile it was a hard fight to get the vote, women eventually received suffrage in 1920: https://www.commonlit.org/texts/was-hard-fight-to-get-vote\n\n***SUBBABLE MESSAGE***\nThank you Edwin for being my best friend.

Few people understand the science behind the psychopath and the sociopath. In this full-length masterclass video, clinical psychologist and personality disorder expert Dr. Ramani Durvasula does a deep dive on the psychopath, the sociopath, and everything you need to know about antisocial personality disorder (ASPD).\n\nThere's a fine line between someone who is overly-confident and someone who has antisocial personality disorder, which is the clinical diagnosis behind psychopathy and sociopathy. Not only are ASPD symptoms and behaviors difficult to spot, it's also far more common than most people realize.\n\nSome of what Dr. Ramani covers....\n- What causes antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) - nature or nurture?\n- What goes on in the brain of a psychopath or sociopath - and whether they can feel remorse or empathy\n- A deep-dive of the signs and symptoms of a psychopath and a sociopath\n- How to tell if your friend, coworker, or even your spouse is a psychopath or sociopath\n- The latest findings and research on ASPD, psychopaths, and sociopaths\n- How to handle a child who is showing signs of ASPD\n- How to cope with a parent, co-worker, boss, sibling, or family member who has psychopathic or sociopathic traits\n- Whether someone with antisocial personality disorder can recover / be cured\n\n“There is no ‘average’ person with antisocial personality disorder. You can find people with antisocial personality disorder everywhere from death row to the best table at the best restaurant in Los Angeles.” - Dr. Ramani Durvasula\n\nGet exclusive video series with Dr. Ramani by visiting the link above.",

                "description": "Why is gender even a thing? To answer that, we’re going back to our three sociological paradigms and how each school of thought approaches gender theory. We’ll look at the structural functionalist view that gender is a way of organizing society into complementary roles, the symbolic interactionist take on how gender guides our daily life, and conflict theory’s ideas about how gender distributes power within society.\n\nCrash Course is made with Adobe Creative Cloud.

                "description": "The Renaissance was a cultural revitalization that spread across Europe, and had repercussions across the globe, but one smallish city-state in Italy was in many ways the epicenter of the thing. Florence, or as Italians might say, Firenze, was the home to a seemingly inordinate amount of the art, architecture, literature, and cultural output of the Renaissance. Artists like Michelangelo, Leonardo daVinci, Sandro Boticelli, and many others were associated with the city, and the money of patrons like the Medici family made a lot of the art possible. Today you'll learn about how the Renaissance came to be, and what impact it had on Europe and the world.\n\nOur Sources:\nHunt, Lynn et al.  The Making of the West: Peoples and Cultures, 6th ed.

America was changing rapidly in the 1960s, and rights movements were at the forefront of those changes. Civil Rights were dominant, but the 60s also saw growth in the Women's Movement, the LGBT rights movement, the Latino rights movement, and the American Indian movement. Also, Americans began to pay a bit more attention to the environment. All this change happened against the backdrop of the Cold War and the Rise of Conservatism. It was just wild. John will teach you about sit-ins, Freedom Rides, The March on Washington, MLK, JFK, LBJ, and NOW. Man, that is a lot of initialisms. And one acronym.  \n\nCrash Course World History is now available on DVD!
