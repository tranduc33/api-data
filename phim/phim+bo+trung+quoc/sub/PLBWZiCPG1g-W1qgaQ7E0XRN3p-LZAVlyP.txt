                "description": "Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012\n\nThe Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10354), informally known as the Reproductive Health Law or RH Law, is a law in the Philippines, which guarantees universal access to methods on contraception, fertility control, sexual education, and maternal care.\n\nWhile there is general agreement about its provisions on maternal and child health, there is great debate on its mandate that the Philippine government and the private sector will fund and undertake widespread distribution of family planning devices such as condoms, birth control pills, and IUD's, as the government continues to disseminate information on their use through all health care centers.\n\nPassage of the legislation was controversial and highly divisive, with experts, academics, religious institutions, and major political figures declaring their support or opposition while it was pending in the legislature. Heated debates and rallies both supporting and opposing the RH Bill took place nationwide.\n\nThe Supreme Court delayed implementation of the law in March 2013 in response to challenges. On April 3,2014, the Court ruled that the law was \"not unconstitutional\" but struck down eight provisions partially or in full.\n\nThe Senate Policy Brief titled \"Promoting Reproductive Health\", the history of reproductive health in the Philippines dates back to 1967 when leaders of 12 countries including the Philippines' Ferdinand Marcos signed the Declaration on Population. The Philippines agreed that the population problem should be considered as the principal element for long-term economic development. Thus, the Population Commission was created to push for a lower family size norm and provide information and services to lower fertility rates.\n\nStarting 1967, the USAID began shouldering 80% of the total family planning commodities (contraceptives) of the country, which amounted to $3 million annually. In 1975, the United States adopted as its policy the National Security Study Memorandum 200: Implications of Worldwide Population Growth for U.S. Security and Overseas Interests (NSSM200). The policy gives \"paramount importance\" to population control measures and the promotion of contraception among 13 populous countries, including the Philippines to control rapid population growth which they deem to be inimical to the sociopolitical national interests of the United States, since the \"U.S. economy will require large and increasing amounts of minerals from abroad\", and these countries can produce destabilizing opposition forces against the United States. It recommends the U.S. leadership to \"influence national leaders\" and that \"improved world-wide support for population-related efforts should be sought through increased emphasis on mass media and other population education and motivation programs by the UN, USIA, and USAID.\n\nDifferent presidents had different points of emphasis. President Ferdinand Marcos pushed for a systematic distribution of contraceptives all over the country, a policy that was called \"coercive\", by its leading administrator.[4] The Corazon Aquino administration focused on giving couples the right to have the number of children they prefer, while Fidel V. Ramos shifted from population control to population management. Joseph Estrada used mixed methods of reducing fertility rates, while Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo focused on mainstreaming natural family planning, while stating that contraceptives are openly sold in the country.\n\nIn 1989, the Philippine Legislators’ Committee on Population and Development (PLCPD) was established, \"dedicated to the formulation of viable public policies requiring legislation on population management and socio-economic development\".[citation needed] In 2000, the Philippines signed the Millennium Declaration and committed to attain the MDGs by 2015, including promoting gender equality and health. In 2003 USAID started its phase out of a 33-year-old program by which free contraceptives were given to the country. Aid recipients such as the Philippines faced the challenge to fund its own contraception program. In 2004 the Department of Health introduced the Philippines Contraceptive Self-Reliance Strategy, arranging for the replacement of these donations with domestically provided contraceptives.\n\nIn August 2010, the government announced a collaborative work with the USAID in implementing a comprehensive marketing and communications strategy in favor of family planning called May Plano Sila.\n\nDON'T FORGET TO SUBSCRIBE!",

He will also touch on the strong history of Philippine-US ties that include not only the trade and security relationship but perhaps most importantly the people to people ties that undergird the relationship.\n\nAbout the Speaker: Jose Manuel “Babe” del Gallego Romualdez was appointed Ambassador of the Republic of the Philippines to the United States of America in July 2017 by President Rodrigo Roa Duterte. On 29 November 2017, he presented his credentials to US President Donald J. Trump and formally assumed office as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary.

He also served as a member of several Philippine business delegations visiting the United States, China, Japan and New Zealand from 1989 to 2012.\n\nAmbassador Romualdez has extensive experience as a media practitioner and business executive. He used to be the Chief Executive Officer of Stargate Media Corporation and Publisher of People Asia Magazine (The Philippine Star affiliate).

                "title": "Understanding Sexual Harassment | Sexual Harassment",
                "description": "What is Sexual Harassment?\nSexual Harassment explained. \nhttp://turnkeydoc.com/training-tutorials/sexual-harassment-training/\n\n\nThe law defines sexual harassment as unwelcome verbal, visual, or physical conduct of a sexual nature that is severe or pervasive and affects working conditions or creates a hostile work environment. \n\n“Conduct of A Sexual Nature” is broken into 3 parts.  Verbal, Visual and Physical. Verbal sexual harassment includes comments about clothing, a person’s body; sexual or gender-based jokes or remarks; requesting sexual favors or repeatedly asking a person out; sexual innuendos; threats, spreading rumors about a person’s personal or sexual life; or foul and obscene language\n\nVisual sexual harassment includes posters, drawings, pictures, screensavers, cartoons, emails or text of a sexual nature. Physical sexual harassment includes assault; impeding or blocking movement; inappropriate touching such as kissing, hugging, patting, stroking, or rubbing, sexual gesturing or even leering or staring. \n\nThere are two categories of sexual harassment: The first is Quid pro quo, which literally means \"this for that\" It occurs when a boss uses job rewards, such as raises or promotions or punishment, such as demotions or firing to force employees into a sexual relationship or sexual act. This is sexual harassment.\n\nThe second is Hostile environment, which is defined as conduct that unreasonably interferes with work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. For example, it may be sexual harassment if repeated sexual comments makes someone so uncomfortable that their work performance suffers or they decline professional opportunities because it will put them in contact with the harasser.\n\nIn both types of sexual harassment, employees must prove that the conduct was offensive to someone, not necessarily the intended victim of the sexual harassment,\n\nHere is an example: Say a male employee tells a dirty joke to a female co-worker. She thinks it's funny, but a second woman passing by finds it offensive. That joke could contribute to a hostile environment claim simply because someone finds it offensive. \nThere are two conditions that determine liability for employers in cases of hostile environment sexual harassment: \n\nThe employer knew or should have known about the sexual harassment, and The employer failed to take appropriate corrective action. \n\nHaving a sexual harassment training program as well as a clear procedure for reporting harassment claims can shield employers from expensive lawsuits. \n\nVisit us at www.turnkeydoc.com for more tips on how to prevent sexual harassment, training materials, as well as a complete library of company policy and procedures.

                "title": "Duterte is Fighting the Catholic Church Over Providing Free Birth Control (HBO)",
                "description": "In the heavily Catholic nation of the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte is fighting the Church on two fronts. On one hand, the clergy recently condemned Duterte’s widely publicized war on drugs, which has left thousands dead since his election in June. On the other, an executive order mandating access to reproductive healthcare and sexual education has triggered a second wave of opposition from the Church and conservatives.\n\nThe legislation, initially enacted in 2012, aims to provide free contraceptives to the country’s 100 million people. By making birth control and other family planning methods readily available, the government hopes to decrease the country’s rising poverty rates. The Philippines is also one of the few countries seeing an increase in teen pregnancy.\n\n“Family planning is very important here in the Philippines because mothers here have five babies, six babies, sometimes 13 babies,” said John Paul Domingo, a registered nurse at a Manila maternity ward, one of the busiest in the world.\n\nVICE News correspondent Seb Walker met with those most affected by the executive order — the desperately poor. He also spoke with those advocating on their behalf and fighting the government order.\n\nSubscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-News\n\nCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.com\n\nFollow VICE News here:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenews\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenews\nTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vicenews\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo",

                "description": "Tagalog/Eng/Nat \r\n\r\nViagra, the headline grabbing anti-impotency pill, is now on sale in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nPfizer, who manufacture the drug, have started delivering to local drugstores in Manila, two weeks after the local Bureau of Food and Drug gave its approval for its sale in the country.\r\n\r\nPharmacies in the Philippines have finally begun to receive their stocks of Viagra.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer Pfizer, started deliveries of the new wonder drug at drugstores in Manila this week.\r\n\r\nSome stores already began selling the drug on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nWith Viagra becoming the talk of the town, drugstore owners are anticipating a huge demand.\r\n\r\nPharmacy owner Bhoyette Vizconde sold five tablets on the first day.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English) \r\n\"I already hoard (laughs) stocks because I'm really expecting that being the first to have Viagra here in our vicinity, I'm sure a lot of people will come here and inquire or buy Viagra.\"\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Bhoyette Vizconde, Owner of Marcelo's Pharmacy\r\n\r\nPharmacy Plus received its first supply early this week.\r\n\r\nOwner James Sandoval, who owns several stores in the capital, put a few boxes of the pill on the shelf to show clients that the drug is now available. \r\n\r\nBut before the drug was put on sale in his stores, Sandoval issued a memo to all his store managers to ensure that safety precautions are practiced before the drug is dispensed to patients.\r\n\r\nThe B-F-A-D says it is important the pill is only sold to patients who come with a legitimate prescription from their doctors.\r\n\r\nEach pill comes with a leaflet giving warnings of possible side-effects if the drug is not taken properly.\r\n\r\nPfizer warned that the drug should not be taken by people being treated with nitrate-based medication for heart problems.\r\n\r\nWhile he expects a huge demand for the drug, Sandoval said Filipino men may be a little shy of asking for the drug themselves.\r\n\r\nHe says the men here will probably not want to admit they need Viagra and so he is arranging a home delivery service to put them out of their misery.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE:  (English) \r\n\"Because maybe at the secrecy of their own home, they can acquire the product because they might be too embarrassed to come forward to admit that they have a sexual problem.  Any person that comes forward asking about the product - they're so defensive, they say right away \"Hey listen I don't have a problem with this. I'm just inquiring\".  That goes to tell you how sensitive the issue is.\"\r\nSUPER CAPTION:  James Sandoval, Owner of A-B Sandoval Drugstore\r\n\r\nDr. Jesus Mendoza is a local doctor who has been checking out the testing of the Viagra drug. \r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE:  (English) \r\n\"Well, I was pretty excited and wanted to find out whether it was really going to work.  Of course, there was some degree of skepticism at first.  But when we started seeing back the patients who were on the study, then it was confirmed that my gosh, this works.\"\r\nSUPER CAPTION:  Dr. Jesus Mendoza, Urologist\r\n\r\nIn a press conference early this month, Pfizer said the approval from B-F-A-D came after they completed a six-month study of its effects on 500 men from six Asian countries, including the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThe man who discovered Viagra, Dr. Peter Ellis, was in Manila last week and spoke of how his drug differs from the others already available in the market.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE:  (English) \r\n\"And I think the beauty of the drug is that it works to enhance the natural process.  All the other products that are out there, you take the product, you get an erection. But Viagra, you take the product, you don't get an erection but it's only when sexually aroused.  So it's basically enhancing a perfectly natural function and restoring it back to normal.\"\r\nSUPER CAPTION:  Dr. Peter Ellis, Discoverer of Viagra\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE:  (Tagalog) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/82332744ffb865c4de45bb3f42e9c31f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

                "description": "Is gender equality a key factor in tackling climate change? Does gender influence the way that environmental issues are solved?\n\nA lecture by Jacqueline McGlade, Jackson Professor of the Environment\n3 March 2020 6:00pm UK Time\nhttps://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/gender-climate-change\n\nIs gender equality a key factor in tackling climate change? Many think so, and in this lecture Environment Professor Jacqueline McGlade will explain why in relation UN Sustainable Development Goal 5 is to 'achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls'. When women are empowered and educated the evidence shows that they have more control over their lives and dedicate more resources to health and education than men. But does gender also influence the way that environmental issues are solved?",

                "description": "Is sex the most dangerous human activity, to all life on earth?\nInterpretation: At its best giving the greatest mutual pleasure humans know....this activity also has risks, both direct and indirect. The direct risks are heart attacks or strokes (mainly in older men!) and STIs (both genders). Other direct risks apply only to uncontracepted sex -- which nature has applied unfairly to women alone, and which can be minimised by voluntary family planning - notably maternal mortality: 1000 deaths each day, 99% in resource-poor settings, including almost 1,000 a week from 20 million unsafe abortions\nBut un-contracepted sex has a danger that is no less serious for being indirect, namely too many humans (up to 7000 million, rising annually by the population of Germany) for sustainability on our finite planet. Humankind's mean environmental footprint is too large but there is also a need to address the number of feet, making the footprints. And we could do it!\n\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",

                "description": "(8 Oct 2019) A seemingly divided Supreme Court struggled Tuesday over whether a landmark civil rights law protects LGBT people from discrimination in employment.\r\nWith the court's four liberal justices likely to side with workers who were fired because of their sexual orientation or transgender status, the question in two highly anticipated cases that filled the courtroom was whether one of the court's conservatives might join them.\r\n\"Justice Neil Gorsuch, among the conservatives, he's President Trump's first Supreme Court nominee, he seemed to suggest that he thought the workers had a good case,\" said AP's Supreme Court reporter Mark Sherman.\r\n\"Reading the text of the civil rights law which prohibits discrimination because of sex. But he said, he wondered whether judges should take account of what he termed the massive social upheaval that he said might result if the court were to rule in favor of the LGBT employees.\"\r\nThe court's four liberal justices appeared likely to vote that a key provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of sex should encompass both sexual orientation and transgender status.\r\nLawyers for the plaintiffs would need one additional vote to prevail. \r\nGorsuch is one possibility. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh did not squarely indicate their views.\r\nThe first of two cases involved a skydiving instructor and a county government worker in Georgia who were fired for being gay. \r\nThe second case dealt with fired transgender funeral home director Aimee Stephens, who was in the courtroom for Tuesday's arguments.\r\n\"These are the court's first cases on LGBT rights since Justice Anthony Kennedy retired,\" said Sherman.\r\n\"Kennedy is the author of the 2015 ruling on gay marriage,.same sex marriage. And he's also the author of all the court's major gay rights rulings so far. Kennedy has been replaced by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who is generally considered more conservative than Kennedy was.\" \r\nA decision is expected by early summer 2020, amid the presidential election campaign.\r\n\r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives \r\nGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/b/102011028589719587178/+APArchive​ \r\nTumblr: https://aparchives.tumblr.com/​​\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/8bb4f3f277174d28a72debb54b5f741b",
